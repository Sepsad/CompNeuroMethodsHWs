## Assignments

### Homework 1

### Homework 2

Exploration of classic neural models including the Integrate-and-Fire model developed by Louis Lapicque (1907) and the Hodgkin-Huxley model (1950s). This assignment examines the evolution from phenomenological descriptions to mechanistic explanations of neural activity.

### Homework 3

Analysis of neural data and spike train statistics. This assignment includes:
- Processing and analysis of simulated neural data (`simdata.mat`)
- Implementation of spike train statistics and analysis
- Exploration of neural coding principles
- Visualization and interpretation of neural responses

### Homework 4

Implementation and analysis of neural network models. This assignment consists of three main parts:
- Part 1: Basic neural network implementation and analysis
- Part 2: Advanced network dynamics and stability analysis
- Part 3: Network learning and adaptation

The assignment includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using Python notebooks and supporting code files.

### Homework 5

Implementation and analysis of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) for decision-making processes. This assignment explores:
- Basic DDM implementation
- Analysis of decision outcomes
- Effects of varying thresholds and evidence
- Relationship between model parameters and decision behavior

## Analytical Homework Assignments

The `CompNeuroAnalyticalHWs` directory contains homework assignments from a complementary course focused on analytical approaches to computational neuroscience. These assignments emphasize theoretical understanding and mathematical analysis rather than computational implementation. The assignments cover:

- Mathematical foundations of neural dynamics
- Analytical solutions to neural models
- Theoretical analysis of neural networks
- Mathematical proofs and derivations

These assignments complement the computational work in the main course by providing a deeper theoretical understanding of the underlying principles.
