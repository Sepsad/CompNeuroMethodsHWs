## Assignments

### Homework 1

### Homework 2

Exploration of classic neural models including the Integrate-and-Fire model developed by Louis Lapicque (1907) and the Hodgkin-Huxley model (1950s). This assignment examines the evolution from phenomenological descriptions to mechanistic explanations of neural activity.

### Homework 5

Implementation and analysis of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) for decision-making processes. This assignment explores:
- Basic DDM implementation
- Analysis of decision outcomes
- Effects of varying thresholds and evidence
- Relationship between model parameters and decision behavior
